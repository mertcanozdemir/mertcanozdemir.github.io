I'm a biomedical engineer, super motivated and with 6 years of experience. I'm all about research and development, and I love using engineering principles to solve healthcare problems. I'm proud to say I've developed some really innovative solutions that have improved patient outcomes. My areas of expertise are medical device design and development, and I've worked on some pretty cool projects that ended up with patents and published papers. When it comes to problem-solving, I like to think outside the box and bring my analytical skills to the table. I'm all about finding effective and efficient solutions. I pay attention to every little detail and am great at working both independently and as part of a team. I'm a great communicator and collaborator and love working with colleagues and stakeholders to achieve shared goals. I'm excited to keep applying my skills to new challenges and opportunities in biomedical engineering, it's my favorite thing to do! My favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/veYakinEvren/).
