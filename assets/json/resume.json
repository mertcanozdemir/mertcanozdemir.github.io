      "summary": "This paper describes the development of a wireless pulse and blood pressure monitoring system based on a microprocessor with low cost. It is aimed to receive blood pressure information (tension) through certain processes such as amplifying and filtering of the signal which is obtained by using BIOPAC SS19LA Blood Pressure Cuff and Transducer. With the designed prototype, it is possible to determine both systolic and diastolic pressure. Following preprocessing of the signal, the information of blood pressure and heart rate data of the patient is wirelessly transmitted to smartphone by using Bluetooth Module. The wireless system is used to transmit the measured data to a remote location. In this way, the biomedical parameters obtained from the patient can be instantly transmitted to any pre-paired smart phone and also recorded in the corresponding device.",

      "releaseDate": "2018-05-30",
      "summary": "The simulation has become an important tool for healthcare practitioners who have difficulty in accessing patients to learn ultrasound imaging modes. The ultrasound phantoms are specially designed objects that are used or imagined to evaluate, analyze and adjust the performance of test devices. These phantoms for ultrasonography devices are expensive, and low-cost alternatives have provided an educational experience that does not give the best result. Ballistic gelatin is a member of the 250-Bloom hydrogel family that resembles human muscle tissue in terms of its mechanical properties. The 250-Bloom Ballistic Gelatin (BG) is prepared with different mixing ratios to be made the mechanical tests such as gunshot, compression and electrical conductivity measurement. The results are compared with the mechanical results of human muscle tissue in order to measure the similarity of the 250-Bloom BG we prepared to human muscle tissue. It is showed that the 250-Bloom BG phantom model has very close mechanical properties to human muscle tissue at time-dependent characteristics of mechanical test results. It is also measured how long it can last without degradation with the time required to use it in the simulation and it is coated with the thermal insulation material needed to extend the degradation period. Based on these results, 250-Bloom BG phantom is recommended as a model for the creation of phantom limb model. Consequently, this model is a much more affordable alternative and easy to produce, it facilitates to work with any organ model in ultrasound imaging for healthcare practitioners.",

      "releaseDate": "2017-10-27",
      "summary": "Phantoms are specifically designed objects that are utilized or imaged to evaluate, analyze and tune the performance of experimental devices. In this project, it is aimed to design a phantom that responds in a similar manner with how human blood circulation would act in specific flow and pressure tests such as pulse measurement. Ballistic gelatin is a member of hydrogel family with 250 Bloom value which resembles human muscle tissue in terms of mechanical features. That’s why we carried out a uniaxial compression test on our gelatin sample to analyze its similarity of human muscle tissue in terms of elastic modulus, stiffness and rupture strength. Test results indicated that our gelatin sample has approximate values with organic human muscle tissue. Designed model was X-rayed and the similarities of the model to human texture were compared. After producing of lower limb phantoms, we carried out a circulation test through them by the aid of a peristaltic pump to simulate the actual blood circulation of human body limbs. This designed phantom is made ready for available flow and pressure tests.",
