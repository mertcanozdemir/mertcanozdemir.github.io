# CLAUDE.md

Working notes for this repository. Read this before making changes.

## What this is

Mertcan Özdemir's personal site at **mertcanozdemir.com**, built on the
[al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) Jekyll theme. Mertcan is a
biomedical engineer (PhD, 2025, on diffusion models for cardiac cine MRI
synthesis), now a researcher at UMRAM, Bilkent University, working on fast MRI
reconstruction. He also played ice hockey for the Turkish national team, and
programs microcontrollers for hobby electronics projects.

## How it deploys

Push to `master` → `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds with Jekyll and pushes
to `gh-pages` → GitHub Pages serves it. **Never edit `gh-pages` by hand**; it is
generated output and every deploy overwrites it.

CI that must stay green: `Deploy site`, `Prettier code formatter`,
`Check for broken links`, `Check for broken links on site`.

## Local environment

There is no Ruby or Jekyll on this machine, but **Docker is installed and the
site builds locally**: `docker compose up` in the repository root serves it on
localhost:8080 with live reload. Prefer this over deploying to check a change.

The prebuilt image now ships Ruby 4.0, which dropped `ostruct` from the default
gems. `jekyll-twitter-plugin` required it and crashed the container on startup;
the plugin was unused and has been removed. If another gem fails the same way,
adding `gem 'ostruct'` to the Gemfile is the fallback — CI is unaffected either
way, since it pins Ruby 3.2.2 and Gemfile.lock is untracked.

`node` is available, and `node_modules/` holds prettier and js-yaml (both
pinned in `package.json`).

## Prettier

`.github/workflows/prettier.yml` runs `npm install --save-dev --save-exact
prettier @shopify/prettier-plugin-liquid`, which **ignores package-lock.json and
installs the latest**. Local and CI once disagreed for exactly this reason, so
`package.json` now pins prettier and the plugin exactly. Keep them pinned, and
run `npx prettier . --check` before committing.

## CSS minifier trap

jekyll-minifier mangles `var()` inside `calc()` — `calc(var(--gutter) - 6px)`
is served as `calc(var( -  - gutter) - 6px)`, which browsers drop. Use a plain
value there, or compute the whole thing in a custom property.

## Two traps that have already caused bugs

1. **The CV page reads `assets/json/resume.json`, not `_data/cv.yml`.**
   `_layouts/cv.liquid` starts with `{% unless site.data.resume %}` and
   `jekyll_get_json` loads resume.json into `site.data.resume`, so cv.yml is a
   dead fallback. Edit resume.json.

2. **Distill posts resolve their bibliography against `/assets/bibliography/`**
   (see `_layouts/distill.liquid`), not `_bibliography/`. `_bibliography/papers.bib`
   is for the publications page via jekyll-scholar; per-post `.bib` files go in
   `assets/bibliography/`.

## Content that is Mertcan's, vs the theme's

The repository was a lightly edited al-folio template and most demo content has
now been removed. What is real:

- `_bibliography/papers.bib` — 10 publications including the 2025 _Diagnostics_
  paper and patent WO2023163682A1.
- `_posts/2025-04-09-spin-echo-sequences.md` — the only real post.
- `_projects/1_project.md` — Endotracheal Tube Cuff Pressure Monitor. **Its six
  images were never committed**, so the figure blocks sit inside `{% comment %}`
  with a note. Drop the images into `assets/img/` and uncomment.
- `_pages/teaching.md` — BMM411 and BMM316, topics taken from the ABYS catalogue.
- `assets/img/` — only `prof_pic.jpg` and `mybrain.gif` (an MRI scan of his own
  brain, shown on the home page).

Anything that reads like "a post with images", Albert Einstein, or lorem ipsum
is theme scaffolding and should be removed, not preserved.

## Conventions

- **Navigation is deliberately three tabs**: publications → cv → teaching.
  `projects` and `blog` keep their pages but sit at `nav: false` until each has
  more than one entry. `latest_posts` and `announcements` are off for the same
  reason. Re-enable by flipping those flags, not by rebuilding anything.
- `imagemagick.widths` is `[200]` because ImageMagick never upscales and the
  largest image is 222px wide. **Raise it when larger images are added**, or the
  srcset will reference files that are never generated — this previously broke
  the link check.
- Upstream workflows that publish Docker images are guarded with
  `github.repository_owner == 'alshedivat'` so they never run here. `Dockerfile`
  and `docker-compose.yml` are kept: they are how INSTALL.md runs the site locally.
- `docs/POST-FEATURES.md` documents the theme's post features (math, mermaid,
  charts, citations…) distilled from the 24 demo posts that were deleted. Its
  Liquid examples are wrapped in `{% raw %}` and `docs/` is in `exclude`.

## Style

Mertcan reads Turkish; write conversational replies in Turkish. Commit messages,
code comments, and site content stay in English — the site is entirely English
(`lang: en`).

He has asked for short answers, and for filler or try-hard phrasing to be
flagged rather than left in ("cringe" was his word — the GIF caption "my brain"
was removed for this reason). He does not want a CV-shaped site that nobody
returns to; usefulness matters more than presentation.

Site copy should be short and plain but still read as normal prose. The about
page was cut from four paragraphs to two; a further telegraphic pass ("I'm a
biomedical engineer. I work on…") went too far and was reverted.

Do not deploy after every change. Commit locally, let work accumulate, and push
when he says so.

## Home — the evidence graph (/)

`_pages/home.md` is the evidence graph from Mertcan's UMRAM project
(`~/Documents/umram-project2-path1`), inside the site's normal layout: title,
a short list of how to use it (no counts, on request), then the graph —
network layout only, drawn by
`assets/js/recon-graph.js` with d3 from cdnjs. The reference method, U-Net, sits
in the middle of the view (`bin/graph-layout.js` pins it to the centre of the
layout). The page opens with U-Net selected and the Other family switched off;
"reset view" clears the selection, search and zoom and shows every family,
Other included. A standalone page in the umram
preview's own look was tried at /graph/ and dropped in favour of this;
`_pages/graph-redirect.html` sends that address home.

The papers/results browser (`_pages/results.md`, `assets/js/recon.js`) is
**hidden, not deleted**: `published: false`, and its dataset and script are in
`exclude` in `_config.yml`. Mertcan wants it back later — the front matter of
`results.md` says how.

- `assets/json/mri_recon_data.json` is copied from the umram project's
  `rapor/site/mri_recon_data.json` and regenerated there with
  `scripts/site_verisi.py`. Never hand-edit it.
- `assets/json/mri_recon_graph.json` is the evidence-graph preview data's
  `methods` and `networks`, with the per-measurement `fit` arrays dropped, plus a
  network layout: **run `node bin/graph-layout.js` after replacing the file**,
  which appends precomputed [x, y] to every node (the force simulation takes
  over a second in the browser).
- That preview data comes from `veri_uret.py`, written in another Claude
  session's scratchpad rather than the umram repo — move it into the umram repo
  before relying on regenerating it. The two data files can come from different
  umram commits (`meta.source.commit` vs `generated`).
- θ is fitted to within-cell differences only, so the graph respects the rule
  that reported values are only comparable within a cell (one paper, one
  protocol). The plan: publish the graph now, and release the extracted data and
  analysis code with the paper (on acceptance, or just before submission). The
  page says so; nothing else from the paper goes on the site before then.

## Hockey drills — /drills/

The page at `_pages/drills.md` animates each drill from `_data/drills.yml` using
`assets/js/drills.js`, which draws an IIHF rink to scale (60×30 m, centred at
0,0) as inline SVG. Styles live under "drill diagrams" in
`assets/css/_custom.scss`. The layout follows the IIHF coaching pad (a copy is
in `docs/iihf-drills/`, gitignored): each drill is the rink with a narrow steps
column beside it, two drills a row from 90rem, one below, stacked on a phone.
Text is kept short on purpose — the animation carries the explanation. Three
drills a row was tried and rejected as too small; full-width rinks as too big.

The 52 drills are **real, redrawn from the IIHF Coach Development Program
Level I Tactical manual** — every drill in its chapter 21 except free play with
no fixed pattern (Chaos Drill, Monkey Drill, 5 x One-on-One, Team Shadowing,
Introduction to Body Contact, Three-on-One In Circle), plus the 2-on-1 give and
go from chapter 20. Each has a `source` with the manual's page. Mertcan asked
for the manual **not** to be linked or cited on the site, and later for the
"IIHF" mentions to go too: the drills page has no description, the about page
says "animated practice drills", and visible text never says "the manual".
The diagrams themselves are cropped into `docs/iihf-drills/<section>/`
(gitignored, the IIHF's material). The original plan was drills from his own
paper notes from an IIHF development camp; those may still come and would sit
alongside these.

**Run `node bin/check-drills.js` after touching any drill** (it exits non-zero
on problems). It loads the real engine and flags passes thrown before the last
one landed, opponents on a pass or shot line (a shot ending at a goalie counts
as a save), overlapping players, speeds over 9 m/s, anyone leaving the rounded
rink, and steps out of order. Every problem it catches has turned up in a real
drill at least once — the 2-on-1 first had the defender inside the carrier's
circle and the shot clipping the goalie.

Data shape (see the header of `_data/drills.yml` for the full rules):

```yaml
- id: give-and-go-pylons
  title: Give and Go Pylons
  category: Puck handling and shooting
  source: { page: "21.11", pdf: 42 }
  duration: 11 # seconds the animation runs
  cones: [[-5.6, 9.2], [-8.3, 7.2], [-10.7, 4.3]]
  actors:
    - id: P
      label: P
      team: n # a blue, b orange (opposition), n grey (passers)
      path: [[-18.5, 8.5]] # one point: stands still
    - id: P1
      label: "1"
      team: a
      puck: true
      path:
        - [-23, 13]
        - [-15, 13, 0.22] # third value pins the time
        - [-17, 1.5, 0.86]
  events:
    - { t: 0.05, type: pass, to_actor: P }
    - { t: 0.15, type: pass, to_actor: P1 }
    - { t: 0.86, type: shot, to: [-26, -0.4] }
  steps:
    - { t: 0, text: "1 passes to P and skates up the boards." }
```

Paths are Catmull-Rom curves through their points. Points without a time are
spread by distance between the pinned ones, so a player skates at an even
speed; pin a time wherever timing matters. Keep one point per line under
`path:` — as an inline list prettier explodes it into a much worse layout.

`steps` is the written description: a numbered list under the diagram, where
the step the animation is in is highlighted and selecting one seeks to its `t`.
**Quote the text** — it sits in a flow mapping, so an unquoted comma splits it.

`t` in an event is a fraction of the drill. **Passes carry no start point**:
they leave from whoever has the puck, and a pass to `to_actor` is aimed at
where that player will be when it lands (flight time grows with distance), so
the puck meets the receiver and then travels with them. Writing explicit
`from`/`to` points for passes caused the puck to teleport — one pass was aimed
9 m from where the receiver actually was.

Several pucks are supported: every actor with `puck: true` starts with one, and
`pucks: [[x, y]]` puts loose ones on the ice. With more than one puck, each
event names its carrier with `by`. A pass with a point `to` (a dump-in, a chip
into space) leaves the puck loose there, as does a shot; `pickup` hands `by`
the nearest loose puck. `nets: [[x, y, angle]]` draws extra goals. All of this
lives in `simulate()` in `assets/js/drills.js`, which also collects data
mistakes as warnings (printed to the browser console).

The page is grouped by the manual's own sections, listed in
`_data/drill_sections.yml` (skating, passing, checking, goalkeeping, evaluation,
team tactics); a section with no drills is hidden. The markup lives in
`_includes/drills/sections.liquid` because prettier flattens HTML nested in the
Markdown page. A grouping by practice phase was discussed and set aside — warm-up,
focus, "ara taktikler" (team tactics: breakouts, zone entries, defensive
systems), "last process" (cool-down), pre-season — partly because Level I has
almost nothing for team tactics or cool-down.

Paths are sampled by arc length, so a player's speed is even between pinned
times; before that, unevenly spaced points made players spike past 15 m/s.

Still undecided, to settle if his own notes arrive:

- Whether Claude transcribes the paper diagrams into coordinates, or builds a
  click-on-the-rink editor so Mertcan can add drills himself.
- Whether the home page splits into two halves (research / hockey). He asked for
  this, but it was deferred until there is enough hockey content to justify it —
  half an empty home page would look worse than the current one.

An earlier attempt — `_data/training.yml`, a filterable table of sessions with
sets and reps — was **rejected and deleted**. He wants diagrams, not tables.
The standalone `drills-preview.html` prototype has been superseded by the page
and is gone too.
